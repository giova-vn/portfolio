                For the past 8 years I have dedicated my life to computer science. Then, I discovered my passion for
                photography. After 4 years of dedicating part of my life to this, I have discovered something: Capturing
                moments in time is an art. To transmit feelings, emotions, characteristics and situations through frames
                is a beautiful thing. To be able to give life to memories just by seeing an instant of the moment. We
                all deserve the opportunity to keep these special moments for ourselves. To be able to enjoy the present
                while remembering the past with a smile.

                I am a Venezuelan living in Chile and working on my passion as a photographer in Chicago, USA. I have
                traveled all over the world. My job allows me to travel several times during the year and see new
                places. My favorite destinations are in the continent of America for its great natural diversity. My
                favorite place so far has been Patagonia. A place like no other for climbing, hiking and beautiful
                photography.

                I have always been passionate about photography, but I really got into it after a road trip with some
                friends. We set out to take as many pictures as possible and weeks after the trip, we were still looking
                at them and reliving the moments together. From then on I take my camera with me on every trip, there
                are always moments or places that are worth saving in time.
